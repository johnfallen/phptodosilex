# phptodosilex
I am a PHP To Do application using the Silex micro framework.

## Installation
Just drop me into a directory on your web server.

## Objective
This application was developed to use the phptodo application classes without any changes so it focuses on the Silex front controller part only. See this repo for the original classes: https://github.com/johnfallen/phptodo
